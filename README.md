# Expense Tracker

Personal expense and income tracker. Installable web app (PWA) that works offline. All data stays on your device (IndexedDB); nothing is sent anywhere.

## Features
- "Update to the latest version" button in Settings (clears cached app files, keeps your data)
- Credit card limits: owed amount, available credit and usage bar per card (warns near and over the limit)
- First-run setup: enter each account and its starting balance before anything else
- Multiple accounts (salary, cash, credit card, other banks) with transfers between them and the balance of each account as of any date
- Quick entry of expenses and income with editable categories (Settings → Categories: add, edit, reorder, archive)
- Recurring payments (installments, bills) with a 12-month paid / unpaid grid; marking a month paid creates the matching expense automatically
- Home dashboard: net with month-over-month comparison, savings rate, daily average and month-end forecast, quick add (frequent categories, repeat last entry), per-category monthly budgets, 6-month trend, unpaid payments with one-tap Pay, entries grouped by day with filter and search, backup reminder
- Arabic (RTL) and English UI, light / dark / auto theme (Settings → General)
- Analytics: variation of any category or income source over 3 / 6 / this year / custom range, repeatability (Regular / Irregular / Occasional), income vs expenses bars
- Backup and restore (JSON), CSV export

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
The production build is written to the repository root, which is what Pages serves (Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / root).
```
npm install
npm run build   # regenerates index.html + hashed assets in the repo root
git add -A && git commit -m "Build" && git push
```
Your app will be at `https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Install on your phone
- **iPhone (Safari):** open the link → Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android (Chrome):** open the link → menu → Install app / Add to Home screen

Open it once with internet so it can cache itself; after that it works offline.

## Your data
Data lives in the browser storage of the device where you use the app, so it is not shared between devices. Use **Settings → Export backup** regularly (and before changing phones or clearing browser data), then **Import backup** to restore.

## Develop
```
npm install
npm run dev     # local dev server (sources in src/)
npm test        # unit tests for the calculation logic
npm run build   # production build into the repo root
```

## Structure
- `src/logic.js` – pure calculation functions (totals, recurring status, analytics, dashboard helpers, budgets); covered by `tests/`
- `src/store.jsx`, `src/db.js` – state, reducer and IndexedDB persistence
- `src/i18n.js` – English / Arabic strings
- `src/Accounts.jsx`, `Home.jsx`, `Payments.jsx`, `Analytics.jsx`, `Settings.jsx`, `AddSheet.jsx`, `PaySheet.jsx` – screens
- `public/` – icons, manifest, service worker (copied to the root by the build)
